## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
* Ubuntu 16.04 and later
* ROS kinetic and later
* Eigen 3 and later
* Toon (https://github.com/edrosten/TooN.git)
* Cuda 9 and newer


## Installing
* git clone https://github.com/tavu/kfusion_ros.git
* catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 

### In case Toon not found
* Opec CMakeList.txt
* comment: *find_package(TooN   REQUIRED)*
* Uncomment: *set(TOON_INCLUDE_PATHS "~/src/TooN")*
* Set proper toon path

### In case Eigen not found
* Opec CMakeList.txt
* comment: *find_package(Eigen3   REQUIRED)*
* Uncomment: *set(EIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR "~/src/eigen")*
* Set proper Eigen3 path
